# 🌐 Piyush Goel's Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website — a minimal, modern, and responsive site built with pure **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It showcases my projects, skills, and a dynamic about section that grows with your scroll, literally.

## 🚀 Features

- 💼 Highlighted Projects with hover interactions  
- 💡 Skills grid organized by category  
- 👤 “About Me” section with dynamic scroll-based image & name morphing  
- 📱 Fully responsive: Desktop and Mobile friendly  
- ⚡ Smooth section navigation with scroll offset  
- 🖼️ Project cards displayed in a clean 2-column layout (1 on mobile)  
- 🛠️ Built for performance, with no frameworks or heavy dependencies  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** for semantic layout  
- **CSS3** with variables, grid/flexbox, transitions, and media queries  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for scroll-triggered animations and interactions
